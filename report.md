## Conclusions
Math scores are more affected by schools size than reading scores. However, both percentages of students who pass math or pass reading falls significantly, from ~90% to 58.29% after a school becomes classified as large (has more than 2000 students). The average budget per student at larger schools is $635 and it is $602 at small and medium size schools. This aligns with the average passing school for math and reading increasing to a high of 90.37% (from a low of 53.53%) as the budget per student decreases from $680 per student to less than $585 per student. 

Charter schools have a signigicantly higher percentage (90.43%) of student passing reading and math compared to non-charter schools (53.67%) . The five highest performing schools are charter schools while the five lowest performing schools are all non-charter district schools. Contributing factors could be school size as charter schools tend to be smaller with an average student population of 1524 compared to the district schools with an average population size of 3854.
