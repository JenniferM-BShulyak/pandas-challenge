* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)!!!CHECK!!!

### Math Scores by Grade ?????????????????????????

??? How do I make my df look like the sample? 

Create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade !!!CHECK!!!

Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending !!!CHECK!!!

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). Use your judgment to create four bins with reasonable cutoff values to group school spending. Include the following metrics in the table:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size !!!CHECK!!!

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
### Scores by School Type !!!CHECK!!!

Create a table that breaks down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).
